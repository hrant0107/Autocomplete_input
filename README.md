# AutoComplete Component test app

## Used resources and Descriptions

[dummyjson](https://dummyjson.com/) - for making real requests and getting mocked data, used from their API for users

CSS - I've used global css for styling

Folder Structure - Keeped approach DRY, KISS, Deletability, Reusability, and Scalability principles. Also used the principle to keep everything composable. 

## How To Run

In the project directory, you need to run:

### `pnpm install`
It will install all dependencies of application (I prefer `pnpm` than `yarn` or `npm`, but feel free and use whatever you want )

#### In case if you don't try `pnpm` run `npm install -g pnpm`

### `pnpm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
